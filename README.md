# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-System
The SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction System is a machine learning model designed to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines, based on the reflected sound waves captured by sonar technology. This system is particularly useful in underwater environments, such as for detecting underwater mines or geological formations.
